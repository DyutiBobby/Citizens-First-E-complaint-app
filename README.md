# Citizens-First-E-complaint-app

Contributors: @Atharva-D, @krushnadurole

This project is a local FIR registration system through Android App. Adequately handling complaints in any situation is most important whether it is corporate or public related. To ensure impartial justice for everyone and get over peopleâ€™s initial fear of considering a police station, we have created an E-complaint app. It is designed at sparking an increase in security in future smart cities while trying to curb the rising corruption crises and provide an efficient means of lodging grievances. Further, an E-complaint system will undoubtedly help in better time management. This system will aid citizens as well as police constables to competently handle emergencies with an immediate alert on accident, theft, or harassment complaints. We sincerely believe this is the foreseeable future, gently helping to bring the local police and the public closer.
